...A transceiver is an electronic device which is a combination of a radio transmitter and a receiver, hence the name. It can both transmit and receive radio waves using an antenna, for communication purposes. These two related functions are often combined in a single device to reduce manufacturing costs. The term is also used for other devices which can both transmit and receive through a communications channel, such as optical transceivers which transmit and receive light in optical fiber systems, and bus transceivers which transmit and receive digital data in computer data buses...<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver">[1]</a></sup>

So, essentially, a transceiver is a unit of communication used to facilitate both, the rx and tx in a radio/optical/digital communications.
They can either be FRUs (Field Replaceble Units) or fixed into the chassis.

Since, transceivers are a very important part of today's communications, and since we all know that the internet is not only run by people, but also designed by people (IETF/IRTF/IEEE etc), similarly, the trasnceivers also have their own set of standards, to ensure, a fair play, inter-op, and relaibility.

### Transceivers in Networks
Trasnceivers are generally classified as CLASS 1 Laser Products. Trasnceivers can be used in combination with cables to establish links between devices. There is a catch. Not all transceivers and cables are compatible with each other. Now, you might be thinking, what kinds of trascnivers/cables/connectors are available at our disposal, and how does one know the compatibility and recommendations? That is where standrds come in.
Please refer to [this](types_t) page for a deep discussion about types of Layer-1 media

There a lot of types of optics/transceivers in networks, based on range/speed/medium/form-factor etc.

### Naming Scheme
After all the discussion of the types of optics, here's how a trasnceiver standard is generally named: <font size="3"> <b style="color: #0969da">UUUU</b>BASE-<b style="color: #daa909ff">GJ</b><b style="color: #da3609ff">P</b> </font>
