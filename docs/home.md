## Architecture Overview
Standardizing the split between markup, style, and logic.

### Why split files?
HTML defines the structure. CSS handles presentation. JS manages interactivity.

### Best Practices
Keep components small and functions pure.

#### Logic Hierarchy
Testing deeply nested headings for the ToC.

##### Function Purity
A core concept in 5+ YOE engineering.

###### Side Effects
How to manage state without pollution.
